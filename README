liblon 0.1 - Lua Object Notation
================================

DISCLAIMER
----------

This project should be considered as a work in progress. At this stage, it is
far from robust, and should be treated as a learning exercise for writing
parsers in C, rather than anything suitable for use in a production
environment.

Please see the TODO file for a list of future plans for this project, and tasks
which could be accomplished by an interested contributor.

OVERVIEW
--------

The overall aim of this project is to create an object notation syntax based
upon the Lua programming language. Analogous to JSON for JavaScript, this would
be based upon a subset of Lua's syntax, allowing for the representation of
objects, but preventing unwanted execution of arbitrary code when interpreted.
