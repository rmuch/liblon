This project originiated as a learning exercise for hand-writing parsers in C,
thus there are many aspects in which it could be improved. These tasks are
planned for the future:

 * Draft a formal specification for the language, including a BNF grammar.

 * Implement LONTable, LONNode as a hashtable rather than a linked list, as it
   currently is.

 * Replace the existing 'test' program with a comprehensive suite of unit
   tests.

 * Fix memory errors. Currently, there are several memory errors you'll pick
   up with valgrind related to uninitialized memory.

 * Implement error handling and reporting.

 * Rewrite the core logic of the parser, based on the lessons learned writing
   the current version, possibly making use of a libraries such as flex and
   bison.
